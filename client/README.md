Fixed Issues: 
1. Private method addPlayer was not working as expected.

private addPlayer(player: Player) {
  try {
    if (this.players[player.id]) return;

    console.log('Adding player:', player.id);
    const newPlayer = this.add.rectangle(player.x, player.y, GameScene.PLAYER_SIZE, GameScene.PLAYER_SIZE, 0xff0000);
    this.players[player.id] = newPlayer;
    console.log('Player added successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error adding player:', error);
  }
}
